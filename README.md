# VandyChat Repository

This is the repository for the VandyChat web app.

VandyChat is an innovative coffee chat generator system designed for Vanderbilt University students, facilitating coffee chat culture between all students to strengthen campus community ties.

In `web-app/` is the actual web application for VandyChat, hosted on <https://vandy.chat>, and `matching-job/` is where the matching algorithm runs for VandyChat. Under `deployment-script/` are a set of yaml files that deploys VandyChat on a K8s cluster.
